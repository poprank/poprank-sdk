# poprank-sdk
 Welcome to the PopRank SDK package!


 This package contains all the building blocks for interacting with the PopRank ecosystem! We use this package ourselves to power `poprank.io` and our various other offerings.

It currently contains two main sections: **types** and **client**

Types are fairly self explanatory.

**client** are thin wrappers on top of our endpoints that make it easier to build with PopRank, by typing the requests and responses.

For in-depth documentation on all the PopRank endpoints, see our [API documentation](https://poprank.readme.io/reference/api-overview).

As always, don't hesitate to reach out to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_poprank) if you have any questions!
